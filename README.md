Name: Halal Casino

Overview: this website was made as a passion project and as an assessment for the CODEBRAVE web development program. In basic terms, it is a casino website that
doesn't take real money, since i wanted it to be playable by everyone, there are multiple ways of gaining tokens in the site. upon loading the site you are greeted by a home page, with multiple
elements, the nav bar on top serves as an easy way to navigate to the most popular pages. the play now button takes you to the game list the pictures are clickable taking you to the appropriate games, and 
last but not least the footer links to socials.

why a Casino? well i really like card games and games of chance, especially when they have subtle strategies that can make you better at them. and what better games envision that description
than casino games, but see due to my religion i cant bet real money, so i chose to make the website use a digital currency with no real life value, only bragging rights.


known bugs: i have tested the site on multiple devices and havent encountered bugs resultant from the code, the only bugs that happen as far as i found were all resultant from downtime in the APIs
used in the website, and or bad wifi connections resulting in bad API calls. 

how to copy or add stuff: the HTMLs are made so that you can add pretty easily if you know how to copy&paste a segment then just rename it. alot of the elements on the site use classes, so you shouldnt
really need to add style properties unless adding brand new elements.


Playing the games:
clicking the shuffle button prior to playing the games involving cards is reccomended.


BlackJack: after navigating your way to the game, it is simple. you should see a number input (an element where you can type a number) and a bet button. after putting a bet that is 
larger than 0 but not larger than your current balance, the game will start. it will give you 2 and the dealer 2 cards. your aim is to be closer than the dealer to 21, but not passing it
clicking the HIT button will give you a card, as long as you are not over 21, you can click hit up to 3 times for a total of 5 cards, at that point you would win automatically. that is called a 5 card charlie
clicking STAND will lock your cards and cause the dealer to draw as long as he is lower that 17 in card value. and the closer to 21 wins. winning awards double the bet amount placed.

HIGH-LOW: High low is a simple game, similiar to BlackJack it has an integer input and a bet button. clicking on the bet button after inputting an amount as a bet will start the game showing the player 1 card.
now the player has a choice of clicking Higher, or Lower, the player is essentially trying to guess whether the card that will be pulled next is higher or lower in value than the current card
for simplicity's sake, the face cards have been assigned their respective number values, jacks being 11, queens 12, and kings being 13. guessing right will award the player double the inputted bet, untill a loss occurs.

Roulette: roulette is one of the more complicated yet simple games, the player like in other games is given an integer input but no bet button. since in roulette where you choose to bet, is your play button.
after writing their bet the player can click one of 4 buttons. clicking on the color oriented buttons will bet on those colors specifically, red and black awarding double the bet amount if correct, meanwhile green awarding 36 times the bet amount due to its small chance of success
the player can also choose to bet on a number, when its clicked a prompt appears telling the player to write the number he or she wishes to bet on. winning this bet awards 35 times the bet amount.
when the bet is played a ball is tossed and rolls around the wheel untill landing on a number to decide the winner, be careful as the wheel likes to play pranks so watch where the ball lands carefully.

Trivia: the solution to running out of points. while you are given 1000 tokens at the start of each day, you can still end up with 0 points, this is where trivia comes in. when entering its page you arent given a bet input
instead a drop down selection and a generate trivia button. choosing a respective category and clicking generate trivia will generate either a multiple choice question, or a true or false question, the contents of which
matching the selected category. answering the question wrong simply notifies the user that they selected a wrong answer without penalty, selecting the right answer though awards the player with 5 tokens, these can be used freely in any game.
trivia can be played an unlimited number of times with no penalties, since it is hard to get every question right, this encourages the user to carefully consider how they spend their tokens.
